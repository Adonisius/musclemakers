# Muscle Makers Project

This project was honestly the result of a rushed and under pressure time constraint. I made many mistakes, and I only started the day before it was due because
of my own personal things. I should have put in the time, but unfortunately this is what I was able to smack together a few hours before the deadline.

## Features

This website gives a ague description of each of the core 6 muscle groups, providing general exercises for beginners and pros alike to workout at home.
Included with these exercises are links to videos describing the exercise and giving an example of how to properly complete said exercise.
It has a flimsy form page that I admit could have been improved seven fold, but I just didn't have the time and had to move on to other things.

### Features Left Out

I was really hoping to try and include a fake shop front, selling things like gym clothing, supplements, etc but again, I was just strapped for time.

## Issues and Bugs

Throughout making the website I was always retroactively checking what each change had on the final product. Whether it be small or large, I was always paying
close attention to any unwelcome changes throught the coding process. There are many bugs that I did not have the time to fix, and many things I would change as well.
The website being viewed on other screens is another major slip up that completely dodged my thoughts through out the entire creation process, and only realised
towards the end just how imperative it really was, but it was already too late.

## References and Links

Throughout the coding, I used a multitude of websites to gather the information I present on screen. Here are the links to the websites I used during the process;

## Deployment

I went to my GitHub settings, under GitHub Pages I deployed from a main branch under /root.

## Final Thoughts

This project was a complete disaster. I procrastinated and let myself crack under the pressure of everything, allowing it to seep in to my project and
coding work. While it may have been a total trainwreck, I believe it has really opened my eyes to the importance of managing my time for effectively,
and I have a newfound resolve to ensure the best of my ability rather than half effort. I apologise for this final product, and I will be sure to keep
on top of my time and managing my responsibilities more effectively.
